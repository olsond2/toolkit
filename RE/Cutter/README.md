# Cutter

## Description
Cutter is a RE tool that combines several other tools (Ghidra, Radare2, etc.). Cutter is a GUI that provides a nice interface to view binaries, disassembled assembly, and even source code. It allows you to edit the assembly as well. The debugging is still in Beta.

## Personal Review
I love Cutter. It's awesome. The debugger, however, is still pretty awful. Perhaps soon the debugger will improve.

## Usage
Simply download Cutter and extract. Run the executable and then open the file you would like to analyze. Little Documentation exists, but enough.
