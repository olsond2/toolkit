<br />
<br />

## Personal Review
This tool worked really well. One thing to note is that FTK is not free whereas FTK imager is. The FTK license server will have to be up when you open up and run FTK
<br />
<br />

## Usage
Simply run FTK, put in the IP address of the license server (leave the default port) and then create a new case. From this case, select the image that you will be examining.
