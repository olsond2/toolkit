# Autopsy

## Description
Autopsy is similar to FTK in that it takes in an image file and performs analysis on it. One main difference is that it has deleted files in a separate location whereas FTK keeps them all together.
<br />
<br />

## Personal Review
Autopsy performs almost as well as FTK. Autopsy, however is free. Unless I had an organization paying for FTK, I would always use Autopsy.
<br />
<br />

## Usage
Open up Autopsy, create a new case, and select the image file to analyze.
