# CapLoader

## Description
CapLoader is a network analysis tool. It provides summary reports of network traffic


## Personal Review
CapLoader is better than Wireshark in a few aspects. For one, CapLoader provides better summaries of different aspects of the traffic.
For example, CapLoader provides information about all of the websites visited, IP addresses contacted, amount of packets per service, etc.
That being said, CapLoader only gives you a free trail.


## Usage
Simply open up CapLoader and then open up the PCAP file you have captured.
