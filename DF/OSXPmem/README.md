# OSXPMem

## Description
OSXPmem is a tool used to get the main memory of a Mac-based machine. Usually, this tool is run from some sort of external drive and the memory is written to another external drive.
<br />
<br />

## Personal Review
Works well, but little documentation exists. As shown below, with just one line you can get all of the main memory and write it out to a file.
<br />

## Usage
osxpmem.app/osxpmem -o [storage device]
<br />
