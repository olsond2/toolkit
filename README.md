# Toolkit
Useful cybersecurity and Digital Forensics

## Description
This project is a collection of tools I found useful during the Digital Forensics class at BYU. The different tools are divided up according to their use (DF=Digital Forensics, RE=Reverse Engineering/Malware Analysis, Other=other). These are not meant to be main repositories of the tools. Instead, they contain a brief description of them and how to get/use them.
<br />
<br />

## Design/Use
This main README has links to each of the different tools. From the top folder structure, there are subfolders which contain the tools for each category.

Also, it is good to know that these tools, in addition to the README which has information, will have the source availble if feasible.

## How this meets the assignment requirements
Github is where I keep most things, including writeups, helpful tools, etc. so I decided that Github would be a good place for me to store these. In addition to my usage, there are a lot of github repos that have information online and a lot of security experts will refer to those online repositories for help.

Each tool has its own README.md, which has the required information.
